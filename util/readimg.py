    Reads and processes the forward flow data from an image file and a JSON file containing data ranges.
    Args:
        img_path (str): The file path to the image containing the forward flow data.
        data_ranges_path (str): The file path to the JSON file containing the data ranges for normalization.

        numpy.ndarray: A 2D array representing the processed forward flow data with normalized values.
    Notes:
        - this is different from the original movi_f code, check comments for detail.
        - The function reads the forward flow image and selects only the y and z channels (ignoring the x channel).
        - The forward flow values are normalized using the min and max values provided in the JSON file.
        - The normalization formula used is:
          `normalized_value = (raw_value / 65535) * (max_value - min_value) + min_value`
